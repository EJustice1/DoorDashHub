# UberDashHub Roadmap

The main goal of this project is to build a replacement/improvement on the para app. 

Basically we want to build a para clone

# Starting Goals

Create a basic user interface with React Native

Create interface that can sign into the various gig apps we intend to use 

Create a setup that can scrap those apps for the data we need 

-Want data on miles driven, along with amount you make off each order
-want to be able to see addresses of houses to deliver to
-These will help with calculating $/mi and $/hr for each platform and overall 

-We eventually want to setup auto decline features for the drivers
-flag orders from certain areas or resturaunts that you dont want to go to 
-Drop off filters

# Apps to Integrate

-DoorDash, UberEats/Driver, GrubHub, Lyft, more to be added
